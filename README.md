A collection of minimal and educational Julia examples using GraphNeuralNetworks.jl for my GSoC 2025 proposal.

# GNN Examples in Julia (Inspired by PyTorch Geometric)
This repository contains a collection of minimal and educational examples using [GraphNeuralNetworks.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl), inspired by classic tutorials from [PyTorch Geometric (PyG)](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io).

The goal is to help new users understand how to apply GNN layers in Julia, by starting from simple examples and gradually reimplementing canonical PyG models and tasks.

# Purpose
This repository is part of my personal learning and contribution process for Google Summer of Code 2025.
All examples are written from scratch in Julia and aligned with the GNN.jl ecosystem.

Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome!
